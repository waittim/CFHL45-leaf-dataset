# CFHL45-leaf-dataset
A dataset includes more than 18000 leaves images, classed by 45 families.

A total of 18,534 leaf sample images were collected, divided into 45 categories, each containing 98 to 1687 samples. The blade image data set was named CFHL 45. The number of samples in the CFHL 45 blade image dataset is larger than that of most existing leaf image datasets. The number of samples in a single class is large, and there are a large number of natural background images with different viewing angles, which can help the model to better target the leaves of each plant.
