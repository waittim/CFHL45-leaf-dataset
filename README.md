# CFHL 45 leaf dataset
A dataset includes more than 18000 leaves images, classed by 45 families.

## Introduction
A total of 18,534 leaf sample images were collected from Chinese Field Herbarium(CFH), divided into 45 categories, containing 98 to 1687 samples. The leaf image data set was named CFHL 45. 

The number of samples in the CFHL 45 leaf image dataset is larger than that of most existing leaf image datasets. The number of samples in a single class is large, and there are a large number of natural background images with different viewing angles, which can help the model target the leaves of each plant better.

All of the image sizes are 160*120.
